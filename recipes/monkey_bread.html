  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Monkey Bread is a sweet, gooey, sinful cinnamon sugar breakfast treat made with store-bought canned biscuit dough
    (in a tube) and lots of butter. This recipe is incredibly easy to make and is seriously the best monkey bread recipe
    ever!</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>24 oz.</strong> refridgerated biscuit dough</li>
    <li><strong>1 cup</strong> granulated sugar</li>
    <li><strong>2 tsp.</strong> cinnamon</li>
    <li><strong>1 cup</strong> butter</li>
    <li><strong>1/2 cup</strong> golden brown sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare pan:</strong> Heavily grease Bundt or fluted tube pan with butter (12-cup capacity). Preheat
      oven to 350°F.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> Separate biscuits and cut each one into four equal bite-sized pieces.
      Combine granulated sugar and cinnamon in a bowl or plastic bag. Drop roll each piece of dough in the
      sugar-cinnamon mixture and shake around to coat. Gently arrange the cinnamon-sugar biscuit pieces into the
      prepared pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Heat syrup:</strong> In a small saucepan, combine brown sugar and butter. Add ½ cup of the remaining
      sugar-cinnamon mixture (discard remaining or use for another recipe). Gently heat to melt butter and bring mixture
      just to a boil and then immediately remove from heat. Stir until sugars have fully dissolved. Do not overcook the
      syrup; you simply want to help the sugar dissolve. Carefully drizzle the warm mixture over the rolled dough balls
      in the pan.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake:</strong>Arrange pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake for about 30 minutes. Time may
      vary; see note below.</li>
    <li><strong>Invert:</strong> Allow pan to rest for about 5 minutes, then cover with a large plate and invert. To
      eat, pull the desired amount off with your fingers (like a monkey would) and enjoy the gooey sweet sinful treat.
